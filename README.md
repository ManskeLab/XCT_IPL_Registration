This repository contains all scripts developed for the manuscript:

***S.C. Brunet, M.T. Kuczynski, J.L. Bhatla, S. Lemay, Y. Pauchard, P. Salat, C. Barnabe, S.L. Manske. The Utility of Multi-Stack Alignment and 3D Longitudinal Image Registration to Assess Bone Remodeling in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients from Second Generation HR-pQCT Scans. BMC Medical Imaging. 2020. doi: 10.21203/rs.2.14575/v1.***

All scripts have been developed using the Image Processing Language (IPL) developed by SCANCO Medical AG for use with XtremeCT2 scan data of the 2nd and 3rd MCP joints.

## Repository Structure
- **multi-stack_registration:** scripts used to align distal, middle, and proximal stacks of HR-pQCT scans to create a single image.
- **bone_remodelling:** scripts that were used to perform bone remodelling analysis.
- **autocontour:** additional scripts used for joint space width autocontouring.
